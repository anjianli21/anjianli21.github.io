I am a PhD candidate in the Department of <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>, advised by <a href="https://beeson.princeton.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Ryne Beeson</a>. I also work closely with <a href="https://vertaix.princeton.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Adji Bousso Dieng</a>. My research interest lies in robotics and generative AI. I’m passionate about building robots that can learn and interact with the world in a way that is both safe and intelligent. I draw inspiration from generative models, e.g. diffusion models, and techniques from numerical optimization and control theory.</p> <p>Previously I did an internship at <a href="https://usa.honda-ri.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Honda Research Institute USA</a>, working on interactive decision-making for autonomous driving. I did my master in computing science at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.sfumars.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Mo Chen</a>. Before that, I received my bachelor in mathematcis at <a href="https://english.bnu.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Beijing Normal University</a>.</p> </body></html>
