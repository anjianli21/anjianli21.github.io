Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ryne Beeson](https://beeson.princeton.edu/). I also work closely with [Prof. Adji Bousso Dieng](https://vertaix.princeton.edu/). My research interest lies in robotics and generative AI. I'm passionate about building robots that can learn and interact with the world safely and intelligently. I am specifically interested in studying generative models, e.g. diffusion-based models, and how they help develop decision-making algorithms for robots. I'm also interested in using machine learning techniques to accelerate complex non-convex optimization problems.

Previously I did an internship at [Honda Research Institute USA](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), working on interactive decision-making for autonomous driving. I did my master in computing science at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), advised by [Prof. Mo Chen](https://www.sfumars.com/). Before that, I received my bachelor in mathematcis at [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/).
