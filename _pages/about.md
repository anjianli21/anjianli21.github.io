Hi! I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ryne Beeson](https://beeson.princeton.edu/). I also work closely with [Prof. Adji Bousso Dieng](https://vertaix.princeton.edu/) and [Prof. Bartolomeo Stellato](https://stella.to/). My research interest lies in robotics and generative AI. I'm passionate about building robots with generative models that can interact with the world safely and intelligently. I'm also interested in using machine learning to accelerate solving complex non-convex optimization problems.

Previously I did an internship at [Honda Research Institute USA](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), working on interactive decision-making for autonomous driving. I did my master in computing science at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), advised by [Prof. Mo Chen](https://www.sfumars.com/). Before that, I received my bachelor in mathematcis at [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/).
